# Modular CMS

This project is a modular PHP backend component built with **Laravel 10**.  
It simulates a **Media Management Module** for a future CMS, with support for media storage, metadata enrichment, and search capabilities.  

---

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+  
- Composer  
- SQLite or JSON file storage (we are using JSON persistence for this challenge)  

Recommended extras:
- [Intelephense VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client) for autocompletion.
- [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tatooin6/modular-cms.git
cd modular-cms
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Generate Laravel application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

---

## Running the Application

This project is not using HTTP routes or controllers.
Instead, all interaction is done via **Artisan commands** in the CLI.

Laravelâ€™s built-in commands work as usual, e.g.:

```bash
php artisan about
php artisan list
```

## Media Module Commands

### 1. Upload a new media

```bash
php artisan media:upload image "Logo" "Company logo" "http://example.com/logo.png"
```

Output:

```
Media successfully created:
UUID: <uuid>
Type: image
Title: Logo
Description: Company logo
URL: http://example.com/logo.png
Date: 2025-09-21 23:15:42
```

The media entry is stored in `storage/media.json`.

Sample media can come from `storage/media.json.example`.

### 2. Enrich media metadata

```bash
php artisan media:enrich <uuid> width=1920 height=1080 format=png
```

Output:

```
Metadata enriched successfully:

### 3. Search media

#### By type:
