# Modular CMS (PHP Backend Challenge)

This project is a modular PHP backend component built with **Laravel 10**.  
It simulates a **Media Management Module** for a future CMS, with support for media storage, metadata enrichment, and search capabilities.  

---

## üöÄ Requirements

- PHP 8.2+  
- Composer  
- SQLite or JSON file storage (we are using JSON persistence for this challenge)  

Recommended extras:
- [Intelephense VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client) for autocompletion.
- [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis.

## üîß Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tatooin6/modular-cms.git
cd modular-cms
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Generate Laravel application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

We are not using HTTP routes or controllers.
Instead, all interaction is done via **Artisan commands** in the CLI.

Laravel‚Äôs built-in commands work as usual, e.g.:

```bash
php artisan about
php artisan list
```
